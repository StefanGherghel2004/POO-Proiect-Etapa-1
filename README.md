Throughout this project, I implemented several classes that interact with each other to create a simplified bank system.
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how these classes work together:

## Interaction of Classes

#### InputHandler Class

#### Bank Class

#### User Class

#### Design patterns

## Potential Improvements
While implementing this project, I realized that the structure could have benefited from a more careful application of
object-oriented design principles. One key improvement would have been the creation of a **skeleton structure** before
diving into the actual implementation, defined by a more strategic use of inheritance and polymorphism to
handle different types of cards (e.g., MinionCard, HeroCard) and game actions. This would help reduce redundancy and
increase flexibility for future changes and expansions.
